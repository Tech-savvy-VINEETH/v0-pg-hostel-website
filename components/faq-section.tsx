    question: 'What is included in the monthly rent?',
    answer:
      'Your monthly rent includes accommodation, 3 meals a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner), high-speed Wi-Fi, 24/7 RO drinking water, housekeeping twice a week, and electricity (with a fair-use cap of 200 units). There are no hidden charges — everything is listed in your agreement.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much is the security deposit, and is it refundable?',
    answer:
      "The security deposit is equivalent to one month's rent. It is 100% refundable upon vacating, provided the room is left in good condition and proper notice has been given. We process refunds within 7–10 working days.",
  },
  {
    question: 'What is the minimum lock-in period?',
    answer:
      'We have a minimum stay of 3 months. After that, you can leave with a 30-day written notice. We do our best to accommodate shorter stays — please speak to our team if you have a specific need.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Is the PG suitable for female residents?',
    answer:

  },
  {
    question: 'What are the visiting hours and guest policies?',
    answer:
      'Guests are welcome in the common areas between 9 AM and 8 PM. No overnight stays are allowed for guests. This policy helps us maintain a peaceful and secure environment for all residents.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I see the room before committing?',
    answer:
      "Yes, and we strongly encourage it! Schedule a free in-person or virtual tour. We'll walk you through the property, show you real rooms (not just staged ones), and answer every question honestly. No sales pressure.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you provide food for all dietary preferences?',
    answer:
      "Yes. Our kitchen offers both vegetarian and non-vegetarian meals. We also accommodate common dietary restrictions — please let us know in advance. Monthly meal calendars are shared so you always know what's being served.",
  },
  {
    question: 'Is there parking available?',
    answer:
